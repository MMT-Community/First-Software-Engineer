Ada Lovelace Day celebrates women in STEM careers, but also raises awareness of the challenges that women have faced in science, as well as the importance of female role models in STEM.

More than seventy years before the invention of airplanes, twelve-year-old Ada Lovelace dreamed of a world where she could fly, leading her to observe birds, investigate different materials that could be used as wings, and eventually write a guide called Flyology. Her curiosity and imagination, though, did not stop there. A mathematician and a writer, she met inventor Charles Babbage at the age of seventeen when he was working on a machine called the Analytical Engine, which was a precursor to the modern computer. Fascinated by it, Lovelace translated a paper on this machine, wherein her notes were three times the length of the original study. Lovelaceâ€™s insights into the potential of the machine went beyond mere calculations, as she envisioned its ability to computer programmer.
